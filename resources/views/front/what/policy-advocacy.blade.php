					<p>BHW carries out evidence based advocacy to change  policies/practices to improve the situation related to quality of care, transparency and equity in the health sector. BHWâ€™s advocacy initiative had led to recognition of concerns around quality of PPE during the covid crisis and resulted in creation of active interest on the issue by media and other quarters which ultimately led the government to address the issue. Going forward, BHW will monitor progress of achievement of health related manifesto of the present political government, review of health sector allocation and use of resources in national budget, and initiatives to provide inputs to the national health sector programme through participation in reviews/appraisals.</p>
