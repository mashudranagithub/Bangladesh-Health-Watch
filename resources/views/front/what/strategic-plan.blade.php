					<p>In XXX, BHW decided to develop a strategy to revisit its objectives and define its vision, mission  objectives and strategies for achieving those in the context of the current health scenario. The strategy was developed through participation of key members of the working group and external third party participants and resulted in a document which was presented and endorsed by the Working Group of BHW. Subsequently, the strategy formed the main basis of designing a project 'Making Bangladesh’s Healthcare Systems More Responsive and Participatory', which was funded by Sida.</p>

					<p>Research/desk reviews/synthesis and/or analysis of existing information/data will need to be undertaken to generate evidence for advocacy in the areas of project focus.</p>

					<p>The exact topics will be selected for each year’s advocacy. The final selection will take place in a Thematic Committee meeting. The research results/review/analysis will be used to gain understanding of issues, succinctly identify the topic of advocacy and develop advocacy strategies on the concerned topic.</p>

					<h2>C. Evidence-based advocacy</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="bhw-text">

					<p>Advocacy initiatives will vary in their design depending upon the topic. The exact strategy for each advocacy topic can only be decided after relevant research has been completed and the exact advocacy topic identified. BHW will engage with all relevant stakeholder groups e.g. professional bodies, business houses, associations, media, etc. to create alliances for achieving the advocacy agenda. The alliance will be developed by having the concerned stakeholder as a member of the Working Group or Thematic Group. The stakeholders and their roles will be identified by the Thematic Groups in course of developing advocacy strategies, based on the advocacy topic. Advocacy strategies may include meetings and lobbying, press events, television talk shows, publication of news and op-eds in popular national newspapers, human chains, town hall meetings, etc. Depending on the topic of advocacy, legal solutions/measures may also be considered, depending upon expert opinion.</p>
